Hi there! 
My name is Andrew, Aka Fyreweaver! I am in my last year of study and am super excited to get into the cyber-security and game development field!
I have been a passionate gamer and enthusiastically been smashing out THM and other Cyber-sec online courses. 
I currently attend school as University Of  Tasmania and in my last year of study! *Fingers Crossed*
